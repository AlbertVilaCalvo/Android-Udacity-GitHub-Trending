# GitHub Trending

Final project of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. 

This Android app displays the trending GitHub repositories (the same you can find in [https://github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending)).

It implements a Sync Adapter that fetches data periodically and stores it into a Content Provider. It has a home-screen collection widget. It displays ads using AdMob.
